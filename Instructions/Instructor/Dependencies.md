# Practice and lab dependencies

To get a list of dependencies for each practice or lab, on VN1-SRV4, VN1-SRV6, VN2-SRV1, or CL1, run
````C:\LabResources\Solutions\Get-Dependencies.ps1````.

To configure the environment, if any labs or practices were skipped, run ````C:\LabResources\Solutions\Invoke-Dependencies.ps1````.

Note the warnings! Some scripts have to be executed on particular computers.
